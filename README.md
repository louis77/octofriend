Octo is your friend.

## Get Started

```bash
npm install --global --omit=dev octofriend
```

And then:

```bash
octofriend
# or, for short:
octo
```

## About

Octo is a small, helpful, cephalopod-flavored coding assistant that works with
any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible LLM API, and allows you to switch
models at will mid-conversation when a particular model gets stuck. Octo can
optionally use (and we recommend using) ML models we custom-trained and
open-sourced ([1](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/diff-apply),
[2](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/fix-json)) to automatically handle tool
call and code edit failures from the main coding models you're working with:
the autofix models work with any coding LLM. Octo wants to help you because
Octo is your friend.

Octo works great with GPT-5, Claude 4, GLM-4.5, and Kimi K2 (although you can
use it with pretty much anything!). Correctly handling multi-turn responses,
especially with thinking models like GPT-5 and Claude 4 (whose content may
even be encrypted), can be tricky. Octo carefully manages thinking tokens to
ensure it's always as smart as it can be. We think it's the best multi-LLM tool
out there at managing thinking tokens, and you'll feel how much smarter it is.

Octo has zero telemetry. Using Octo with a privacy-focused LLM provider (may we
selfishly recommend [Synthetic](https://synthetic.new)?) means your code stays
yours. But you can also use it with any OpenAI-compatible API provider, with
Anthropic, or with local LLMs you run on your own machine.

Octo has helped write some of its own source code, but the codebase is
human-first: Octo is meant to be a friendly little helper rather than a
completely hands-free author, and that's how I use it. But if you want to live
dangerously, you can always run `octofriend --unchained`, and skip all tool and
edit confirmations.

## Sandboxing Octo

Octo has built-in Docker support, and can attach to any Docker container
without needing special configuration or editing the image or container. To
make Octo run inside an *existing* container you have running — for example, if
you already have a Docker Compose setup — run `octo docker connect
your-container-name`.

To have Octo launch a Docker image and shut it down when Octo quits, you can
run:

```bash
# Make sure to add the -- before the docker run args!
octo docker run -- ordinary-docker-run-args
```

For example, to launch Octo inside an Alpine Linux container:

```bash
octo docker run -- -d -i -t alpine /bin/sh
```

All of Octo shell commands and filesystem edits and reads will happen inside
the container. However, Octo will continue to use any MCP servers you have
defined in your config via your host machine (since the MCP servers are
presumably running on your machine, not inside the container), and will make
HTTP requests from your machine as well if it uses the built-in `fetch` tool,
so that you can use arbitrary containers that may not have `wget` or `curl`
installed.

## Rules

Octo will look for instruction files named like so:

- `OCTO.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

Octo uses the *first* one of those it finds: so if you want to have different
instructions for Octo than for Claude, just have an `OCTO.md` and a
`CLAUDE.md`, and Octo will ignore your `CLAUDE.md`.

Octo will search the current directory for rules, and every parent directory,
up until (inclusive of) your home directory. All rule files will be merged: so
if you want project-specific rules as well as general rules to apply
everywhere, you can add an `OCTO.md` to your project, as well as a global
`OCTO.md` in your home directory.

If you don't want to clutter your home directory, you can also add a global
rules file in `~/.config/octofriend/OCTO.md`.

## Connecting Octo to MCP servers

Octo can do a lot out of the box — pretty much anything is possible with enough
Bash — but if you want access to rich data from an MCP server, it'll help Octo
out a lot to just provide the MCP server directly instead of trying to contort
its tentacles into crafting the right Bash-isms. After you run `octofriend` for
the first time, you'll end up with a config file in
`~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`. To hook Octo up to your favorite MCP
server, add the following to the config file:

```json5
mcpServers: {
  serverName: {
    command: "command-string",
    args: [
      "arguments",
      "to",
      "pass",
    ],
  },
},
```

For example, to plug Octo into your Linear workspace:

```json5
mcpServers: {
  linear: {
    command: "npx",
    args: [ "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse" ],
  },
},
```

## Using Octo with local LLMs

If you're a relatively advanced user, you might want to use Octo with local
LLMs. Assuming you already have a local LLM API server set up like ollama or
llama.cpp, using Octo with it is super easy. When adding a model, make sure to
select `Add a custom model...`. Then it'll prompt you for your API base URL,
which is probably something like: `http://localhost:3000`, or whatever port
you're running your local LLM server on. After that it'll prompt you for an
environment variable to use as a credential; just use any non-empty environment
variable and it should work (since most local LLM server ignore credentials
anyway).

You can also edit the Octofriend config directly in
`~/.config/octofriend/octofriend.json5`. Just add the following to your list of
models:

```json5
{
  nickname: "The string to show in the UI for your model name",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:SOME_PORT",
  apiEnvVar: "any non-empty env var",
  model: "The model string used by the API server, e.g. openai/gpt-oss-20b",
}
```

## Debugging

By default, Octo tries to present a pretty clean UI. If you want to see
underlying error messages from APIs or tool calls, run Octo with the
`OCTO_VERBOSE` environment variable set to any truthy string; for example:

```bash
OCTO_VERBOSE=1 octofriend
```
